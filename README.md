## 🎬 Netflix Movie & TV Suggestion Expert using Gemini + Pinecone

>special thanks to **@RohitNegiSir** for guidance and inspiration.

### 🔍 Project Description

This project is a **query-aware AI movie and TV show recommendation system**, powered by:

* **Gemini (Google Generative AI)** for content generation and embeddings
* **Pinecone Vector DB** for semantic search over a custom dataset
* Based on **LangChain**, it rewrites follow-up queries into full, standalone questions and answers them based on contextual matches from a dataset (`Netflix.csv`).

### 📁 File Structure

```bash
├── query.js          # Main chatbot that interacts with user queries
├── dataindexing.js   # One-time script to index Netflix dataset into Pinecone
├── Netflix.csv       # Your dataset (not uploaded here, but used in indexing)
├── .env              # Environment variables (API keys, index names, etc.)
```

### ⚙️ Features

* 🧠 Gemini-powered intelligent query rewriting
* 📚 Context-aware answers using similarity search from Pinecone
* 🎥 Suggests **similar movies/shows** purely based on **plot description**, **not by type/genre/language**
* 🗃️ Chunking & vectorizing of dataset with LangChain
